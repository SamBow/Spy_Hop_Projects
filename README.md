## Projects

### Environment Protection

Simulate the degradation of the world's oceans as oil tankers spill oil into the ocean. Play as a mythical creature, the kraken, to attempt to stop the destruction of the ocean with the use of a slingshot mechanic. Mouse click and drag to operate slingshot.

Features:
<ul>
<li> Random Generation</li>
<li> Slingshot</li>
</ul>

End:
Once the oil tanker fully lowers it's drill, the ocean begins to progressively fill with oil.

### Infinite Runner

A collection of two different displays for simulating a population of cockroaches.

The first class, RoachPopulationViewer, displays an interactive GUI to modify and change the values of the population of
roaches.  It also has an exterminator come every 10 seconds to kill 10% of the population

GUI

The second class, Roaches,  visualizes the growth of a roach population over a timeframe of 10 generations.  A timer waits
1/2 of a second before either doubling the population or killing a portion of the population.  The simulation lasts 10 seconds.

This program This program simulates the population of earth every fifty years
during either a time of peace or during a zombie apocalypse with the user
playing as God.

This interactive console application stores the current world population in millions and then asks the user if it is a zombie apocalpyse or a time of peace.  The population is then changed accordingly.

### Math Shooter
This class reads terrain values and a water level value and determines which terrain will be above the water or flooded.

A Map is randomly generated with terrain of different altitudes.

The map is then slowly flooded in increments of 10 until it is full.
